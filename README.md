### Current Version: v1.2.3

This tool is a simple interface that allows injection of image faults into robot cameras. Thanks to this interface, you can create new image libraries by injecting the fault types you have determined, both real-time to TOF and RGB type ROS cameras, and to the image libraries previously recorded by these cameras.

### Tool Features (in v1.2)
---------------------------
- You can apply the faults you choose in the configuration menu to the images in the image library you want, and save these wrong images to the folder you want.
- You can apply these faults to all images as well as to a random number of images, creating a mixed library of faulty images without touching the remaining images (only offline fault application).
- You can save the configuration of the fault you have applied, and view the fault plans you have saved as you wish.
- You can specify the rate of fault to be applied.
- For now, three different fault types can be applied offline to images (with .bmp extension) obtained from TOF camera.
- For now, six different fault types can be applied offline to images (with .jpg or .png extension) and real-time stream obtained from RGB camera.
- You can watch ROS Camera streams.
- You can specify the rate of real-time fault injecting frequency to be applied.

### Usage
----------
This tool is compatible to ROS Noetic (not tested in ROS Melodic).
For launching CamFITool:
    
    roslaunch camfitool start_camfitool.launch

Changelog:
----------
Update v1.1 - 03.11.21
------------------------
- First Commit

Update v1.2 - 10.11.21
------------------------
- Added Real-time FI mode
- Added RGB Camera FI types (Open, Close, Erosion, Dilation, Gradient and Motion-blur). Now this interface supports two camera types and nine fault types.
- Added Robot Cam button. This button provides to show active ROS camera (tried ROS Noetic) screen (User must enter ROS Camera topic name).
- Robot Camera section is active now. User can enter ROS camera topic name for fault injection and enter ROS fault injecting stream frequency value.
- Added Real-time FI plan saving standart. This plan saving is different than Offline FI plan ones.
- Some bug fixes, new error pop-up messages and other things.

Update v1.2.1 - 01.12.21
------------------------
- Added Error Log system.
- Fixed randomized fault injection function issue.

Update v1.2.2 - 03.12.21
------------------------
- CamFITool's software codes are revised (using [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) and [Prospector](https://pypi.org/project/prospector/)).

Update v1.2.3 - 06.12.21
------------------------
- Fixed "Known Issues #4: Offline RGB Randomized FI crash" bug
- Fixed "Known Issues #3: Image Formats"
- New image databases added (These images taken from [COIL Database](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roadmap For Next Updates:
-------------------------
* [x] Offline Type Fault Injection
* [x] TOF Camera FI
